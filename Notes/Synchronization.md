1. Implicit Wait
2. Explicit Wait

**Explicit Wait can be achieved in two ways one by using Web Driver wait and another is Fluent Wait.**
- Fluent Wait finds the web element repeatedly at regular intervals of time until timeout or till the object gets found.
- Unlike WebDriver Wait, we need to build customised wait methods based on condition.
- Both WebDriver wait and Fluent Wait classes implement Wait interface.
